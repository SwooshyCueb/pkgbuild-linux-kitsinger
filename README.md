linux-kitsinger PKGBUILDs
-------------------------

PKGBUILDs for Linux kernel Arch packages with patchsets and config tweaks for
my personal use-cases.

linux-aufs-fsync was the first iteration (using linux 5.7), but once I realized
that this is something I would need to maintain long-term, I decided to rename
the packages to linux-kitsinger-* and create separate packages for each major
kernel release I build.
